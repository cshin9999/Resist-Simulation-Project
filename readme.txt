This project is for a stochastic simulation of a EUV resist in order to optimize line edge roughness and acid concetration. The simulation uses a voxel model with each voxel assumed to be 1nmx1nmx1nm

The data is displayed through matplotlib's 3d plot

Note: This is still early in the draft and the code still needs to be cleaned for pep8 standards and readability
